# Oscillatory patterns in expression during the larval development of C. elegans.
The repo contains code that reproduces and extends results from the paper [Developmental function and state transitions of a gene expression oscillator in Caenorhabditis elegans](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20209498) published by the group of Helge Grosshans, Friedrich Miescher Institut, Novartis.

## Cosine fitting
The gene expression shows a periodic signal with a period around 7.5 hours.
